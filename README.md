# Git and GitHub practice

You will work on this project together as a team. You will practice cloning, pulling, committing, pushing changes to GitHub, creating pull requests (PR), merging and resolving merge conflicts and more.

## Team name

Come up with a team name for your team. Do not spend more than 5 minutes on this. This is for fun only and will be used today only (unless you want to continue to use it later).

## Tasks

You will work on all of these tasks individually. Once done, create a PR, share the URL link to your PR to your team members and ask them to review it. You will need at least two approvals to merge your PR to main.

### Features

- Change the title of the page from document to something else.

- Add a `<nav>` element and add links inside the `<nav>` element as an unordered list. Make sure there are at least three links with one of them being your team name.

- Add a title and a short paragraph to `<header>` element to describe what this page is about. Use semantic HTML and proper elements. There is no text provided, be creative. Use appropriate content.

- There are the names of the book titles given in the `<main>` element however we would like to make it an ordered list.

- There is a text given in between commented sections. Create a proper table using that text as a content.

- Change the input type button in the form to use button element instead.

- Make the link about Wikipedia page in the footer to open in a new tab.

- Create an HTML page and name it your team name. Inside the HTML page, add boilerplate for HTML 5. Inside the body, add a title that is the team name.

- Add info about you to the team page. Add at least a sub-title that is your name and a short paragraph about yourself. (You can choose to do this after the previous step is done, meaning after one of your teammates created the team page.)

### Bugs

- There is an image in the character selection but not displaying correctly.

- I cannot change my character selection from Dwarf to Elf. It selects both of them.

- Clicking the email should direct to sending an email but there is a bug and it is not working properly.

- Clicking the phone number should direct to making a call but there is a bug and it is not working properly.
